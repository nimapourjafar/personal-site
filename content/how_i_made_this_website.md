# Welcome!

I still have no idea how to use this system I made for blog generation, but if you're seeing this then I figured it out!

I'm Nima! I do a lil bit of coding and needed a way to show to people what I've done, and a lot of my really cool friends told me a personal website is the best way to do that. 

And it was long overdue.....![Me being lazy](https://imgur.com/xvsiDiP.jpg)


So after running a quick `create-next-app`, I got to work A.S.A.P. to create my personal portfolio

# The *Steps*

## Design 
I used **Figma** to create a really quick draft of how I wanted the website to look.

I wouldn't say ~~graphic design is my passion~~ I have a very good taste in design, but I was able to take inspiration from a lot of really cool personal websites I've came across.

Some really essentialy things I've noticed is that...

 - You need an established color theme
 - Font size matters
 - Try to fill the page with interactive elements, otherwise let your content speak for itself
 - Always have one of those typing thingys on your front page, like seriously everyone has one of them for some reason

Other than that, it was fun dragging and dropping stuff to create the design, but now it was time to actually ***write*** ***code*** for it.

## Stack
I was playing a lot with ***Next.js*** at the time of making my website, and I'm really happy that I used it. It makes routing and components really easy to manage/make and it also boosts the SEO of the website for free since it uses SSG (Static Site Generation).

I would highly recommend using some sort of front-end framework and not vanilla HTML/CSS, unless you want a challenge or you're just a god.

The languages I used were mostly ***Javascript*** and a tiny bit of ***CSS***. I opted to use ***TailwindCSS*** for styling, and it is a blessing from god to a frontend dev. 

There isn't much of a backend to my website. I used the ***Spotify API*** to create the cool component in my navbar, and that's pretty much it.

## The "Complicated Stuff"
My blog, project, and work experience system were probably the most "complicated" parts of making this website, but they are fairy simple to any novice programmer. 

I just stick data as a JSON for my projects and work experience and display those dynamically, just for ease of updating.

My blogs use markdown files to dynamically update. It makes it easier for me to write my blogs and also style them. This is no system that I've made by any means; I just implemented some fundamentals to make my website easier for both users to use and me to update.

## The Hardest part
The hardest part had to be me filling up all the static data (my work experience, projects, ect.).

It's very weird talking about yourself, but hey that's why you make a website.

## Steps Done ✅

That's mostly all it takes. 

# Next Steps

First things first is to get a proper domain, I love vercel but this url is too ugly.

I'm hoping to add more interactivity to these blogs and add custom components, I think they'd be really cool. 

I also want to make it so that my website has nice embeds when the link is shared on places like twitter or discord.

I also may want to add a commenting system to my blogs as well.

# Conclusion

Otherwise, I'm pretty happy with how it turned out. I'm also having fun writing this first blog and hope to produce more in the future.

These blogs will differ from my "professional" writing work, and they will be more light hearted and informal.

Anyways, hope y'all enjoy and take care!
